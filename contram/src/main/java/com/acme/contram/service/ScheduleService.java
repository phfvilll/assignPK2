/**
 * ScheduleService provides the method createSchedule(String[] proposals) to create a Track-based schedule
 * of talks from a passed String-Array that contains the proposals for the talks.
 *
 * The method createSchedule(String[] proposals) consists of three parts.
 *
 * Through the first part, the method recognizes talks in a passed String-Array of proposals.
 * It checks if a talk title exists, if a String is completely empty, if a talk title contains numbers,
 * if the duration of a talk would even fit in a session (for this it have to be between 1 and 240 minutes)
 * and if the proposal have a correct time indication at the end of its String.
 *
 * Accepted input formats for proposals are:
 * "[talk title without numbers] [number between 1 and 240]min"
 * and
 * "[talk title without numbers] lightning".
 *
 * Through the second part, if the reading of the proposals is finished, the scheduling process begins
 * to assign the recognized talks to sessions which are properties of the tracks.
 *
 * Through the third part, as a result of the scheduling process the method creates a printable version
 * of the schedule as an Array of Strings.
 *
 * The method returns a String-Array including the printable schedule which first field serves in the
 * current version to hand over the amount of errors that occur during the reading of the proposals.
